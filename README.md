One of the key challenges in machine learning is ensuring that models are certifiable, meaning they are trained on unbiased data or with robust algorithms to guarantee reliable inferences. Traditional certification methods involve third-party auditors inspecting and signing off on models, but this approach has limitations due to concerns about disclosing proprietary models and intellectual property theft. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) offer a solution by allowing ML companies to prove the validity of their models without revealing the underlying algorithms or data. Instead of distributing the model, companies can run inferences and provide results along with a ZKP that certifies the use of an auditor-approved model. This method protects proprietary information while enhancing trust and transparency in ML deployments.
